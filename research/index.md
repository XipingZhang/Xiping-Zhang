Research Interest
</h2>
<p>
My research interest is the study of singularities arose from geometry. On one side I work on  the singularities of  mappings, especially on their applications to enumerative geometry such as the Thom polynomials.
On the other side I also work with the singularities of algebraic varieties, mainly on
the computation of the characteristic classes and the geometric invariants. In particular when the varieties are group  orbits, my work concerns
how to relate the  representation theory of the group action with the characteristic classes and topological invariants of the orbit spaces.
